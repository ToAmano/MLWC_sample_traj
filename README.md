# MLWC Sample Trajectories

This repository provides sample molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories for use with the MLWC library, which employs machine learning techniques to calculate dipole moments from Wannier centers. ￼

## Overview

Due to GitHub’s storage limitations, this repository contains only a subset of small-sized trajectory data. Larger datasets are hosted externally on Google Drive.

## Contents
	•	traj/ directory: Contains sample MD trajectories for small systems.
	•	For example, traj/methanol/ includes trajectory data for methanol molecules. ￼

## Accessing Larger Datasets

For larger trajectory datasets not included in this repository, please refer to the following Google Drive link:

## Usage

These trajectory files are intended to be used as input for the MLWC library. Ensure that the file paths and formats are compatible with MLWC’s requirements. For detailed instructions on how to use these trajectories with MLWC, please consult the MLWC documentation.
